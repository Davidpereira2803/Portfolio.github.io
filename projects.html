        <p>
        Hello everyone and welcome to my personal project web site. On this website you will find
        every information you may need about me and all the projects I have worked on and contributed to.

        <p>
            During my studies I have worked with the Automation and Robotics Research Group (ARG), to do my Bachelor Semester Project. <br>
            In my second semester <strong>(<a id="links" href="https://github.com/Davidpereira2803/BiCS-BSP-S2-SLAM-in-drone-robotics">BSPS2</a>)</strong> I have worked with a DJI Tello drone and ORBSLAM3 to create maps of environments using the drone. I created a benchmark
            program to compare different sensors in different environments. <br>
            For my third semester I have worked again with ARG, but this time I contributed to a project of them, where I worked in a ROS environment
            to create a Behavior Tree to control different drone capabilities.

                <li>Portfolio Website</li>
                <p>
                    The Portfolio Website is the site you are currently on, I developped the website to present the work that I am doing, so I also include it into my project portfolio. 
                    The website is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and also uses external tools/services to allow and facilitate some manpulations.

                <li>Botanicals App</li>
                <p>
                    The Botanical App is a python program with a simple User Interface to manage and create Gin recipes. This app is kept very simple
                    and is only programmed to store and manage the inventory of the gin producer and to compose the gin recipes with the materials from the inventory.
                    Furthermore, the app allows to make some useful computations, such as a dilution calculator, which is handy for the production of the gin. 
                    <br>
                    The app is working, but some new features may be added in the future to make it more complete and perhaps actualy usable for a DIY gin producer.
