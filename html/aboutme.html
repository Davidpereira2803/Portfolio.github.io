        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            If you came this far you are probably wondering who I am, well I am David a 20 year old Computer Science student,
            who is deeply interested in programming and IT in general. <br>
            Currently I am a second year Computer Science student at the University of Luxembourg and I am preparing to later on
            become a Software Engeneer.

            <h2>What Projects have I contributed to?</h2>
            <p>
                During my studies I have worked with the Automation and Robotics Research Group (ARG), to do my Bachelor Semester Project. <br>
                In my second semester <strong>(<a id="links" href="https://github.com/Davidpereira2803/BiCS-BSP-S2-SLAM-in-drone-robotics">BSPS2</a>)</strong> I have worked with a DJI Tello drone and ORBSLAM3 to create maps of environments using the drone. I created a benchmark
                program to compare different sensors in different environments. <br>
                For my third semester I have worked again with ARG, but this time I contributed to a project of them, where I worked in a ROS environment
                to create a Behavior Tree to control different drone capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                These Projects gave me the possibility to work with robots and discover the world where everything should work but nothing does work.
