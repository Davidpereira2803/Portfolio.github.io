I created a benchmark program to compare different sensors in different environments. <br> For my third semester I have worked again with ARG, but this time I contributed to a project of them, where I worked in a ROS environment to create a Behavior Tree to control different drone capabilities."

        "content":"During my second semester I worked on a project with 2 classmates as part of the Programming Fundamentals 2 course. The project consisted in developping a Pokemon game in a Java environment given a starting code, which included a 2d map and a keyboard controlable Pokemon. As a group we developped a Tower Defense game where 2 players could fight agains each other and destroy the towers to win the game. We also implemented some consumables that gave the pokemon more movement speed or more health. <br> This project showed me how difficult it actually is to code in a team, we had to divide tasks, talk about the progress and possible errors/bugs, but also set up a working GitHub environment so that each developper can code without destroying the main code.
