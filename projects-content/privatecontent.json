        "description": "The Botanical App is a python program with a simple User Interface to manage and create Gin recipes. This app is kept very simple and is only programmed to store and manage the inventory of the gin producer and to compose the gin recipes with the materials from the inventory. Furthermore, the app allows to make some useful computations, such as a dilution calculator, which is handy for the production of the gin. <br> The app is working, but some new features may be added in the future to make it more complete and perhaps actualy usable for a DIY gin producer.",

        "description": "This project consists of developping a cross platform Grade Calculator app specifically for the University of Luxembourg. <br> I came up with this idea, because I don't like to always check my midterms/homework grades on moodle or even on paper. There are many solutions out there to store the grades, but none of the solutions was good enough for me. Thus, I decided to make my own app and perhaps even make it available for everyone in the future.",
