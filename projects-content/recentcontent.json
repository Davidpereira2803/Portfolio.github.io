        "description": "This project consists of developping a cross platform Grade Calculator app specifically for the University of Luxembourg. <br> I came up with this idea, because I don't like to always check my midterms/homework grades on moodle or even on paper. There are many solutions out there to store the grades, but none of the solutions was good enough for me. Thus, I decided to make my own app and perhaps even make it available for everyone in the future.",

The grades and account are stored in FireBase, thus they are accessible from around the world and each user can access them in all their devices via the website. <br> This project is set to be finished rather soon and be available for free.",
